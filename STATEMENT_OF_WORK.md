# Statement of Work: Number Guessing Game

## Project Overview
Development of a browser-based number guessing game as part of the 100 Days of Code challenge (Day 2). The game will generate a random number between 1 and 100, and players will try to guess it with feedback provided after each attempt.

## Scope of Work

### Deliverables
1. Functional browser-based number guessing game
2. Complete source code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
3. Documentation (README.md)
4. Version control setup (Git repository)

### Features
1. **Game Logic**
   - Random number generation (1-100)
   - Input validation
   - Guess evaluation (too high/low/correct)
   - Game state tracking

2. **User Interface**
   - Clean, responsive design
   - Input field for guesses
   - Feedback messages
   - Previous guesses display
   - Attempt counter
   - Best score tracking
   - New game button

3. **Data Storage**
   - Local storage for best score persistence

## Technical Requirements
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6)
- No external libraries or frameworks
- Compatible with modern web browsers

## Timeline
- Design and planning: 1 hour
- HTML/CSS implementation: 1 hour
- JavaScript implementation: 2 hours
- Testing and debugging: 1 hour
- Documentation: 0.5 hours
- Version control setup: 0.5 hours
- **Total estimated time**: 6 hours

## Success Criteria
- Game correctly generates a random number
- Game accurately validates user input
- Game provides appropriate feedback for guesses
- Game tracks and displays number of attempts
- Game stores and displays best score
- UI is responsive and user-friendly
- Code is well-structured and documented
- Project is properly versioned with Git

## Future Considerations (Out of Current Scope)
- Difficulty levels
- Time-based scoring
- Sound effects and animations
- Multiplayer functionality

## Development Environment
- Code Editor: VS Code or similar
- Browser: Chrome, Firefox, or similar for testing
- Version Control: Git with GitHub repository
